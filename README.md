# Robin_2023-Anchoring-Time
This script is referenced in graduate student Susan Reed's M.S. thesis in Biology at Indiana University, summer 2024: "_________"

This script that uses the "changepoint" package in R Studio version 4.2.2 to anchor phenological time between two populations of the American robin songbird, 
<em>Turdus migratorius</em> â€” one that breeds in Anchorage, AK, and another that breeds in Bloomington, IN.

<b>"#1. Time Series"</b> : This script is used to edit time series format of a .csv file that was created as an exported time series chart from ArcGIS Pro (see "GIS TS Chart Output" folder).

<b>"#2. Changepoint Analysis"</b> : This script identifies changes in bird abundance over time.

<b> "Changepoint Results" </b> : A folder that includes files that show the plotted results of the changepoint analysis from R Studio--one file for Indiana and another for Alaska.

<b> "GIS TS Chart Output" </b> : A folder that includes .csv files created in ArcGIS Pro that are the products of exported time series charts (pictures of these charts can also be found in this folder).
